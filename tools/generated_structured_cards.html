    <p>Description A successful polargraph-style whiteboard drawing robot built from scratch for an advanced programming course. It receives drawings from a custom web UI hosted on an ESP32 and draws them on a 1m x 1m surface.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This was our Quarter 1 project for a new, open-ended Advanced Computer Programming course. Working with my friend Edwin Tenney, our goal was to create a robot that could draw on a classroom whiteboard. This project was defined by rapid iteration and overcoming significant design failures. Our initial ideas included: 1. Magnetic Robot: Quickly scrapped due to complexity. 2. Vertical Rail Robot: A detailed concept (documented separately) that was scrapped due to a lack of necessary parts. 3. Sprocket/Bead Chain Robot: Scrapped under time pressure after we failed to CAD a functional sprocket for a non-standard bead chain. Facing a deadline, we made a time-based decision and pivoted to a Polargraph design. This successful iteration used string spools and cables, precisely controlled by gobilda motors with encoders, hanging from the top of the whiteboard to control the marker's position. The system's architecture was a custom integration of two microcontrollers: ● Main Brain: An FTC Control Hub running Java handled the robot's movement logic. ● Web UI: An external ESP32, connected to the Control Hub, hosted a Wi-Fi access point and a virtual drawing UI. --- PAGE 176 --- A user could connect a tablet to the ESP32's Wi-Fi, navigate to its IP address, create a drawing, and hit "Export." The drawing data was sent to the Control Hub, which waited for a human (us) to confirm the print by clicking a button on a game controller. We earned a 100% A+ on the project and continued to improve it for a week while it was at school. Key improvements included: ● Bug Fix: We discovered we had mistakenly input diameter into a radius variable, which was halving our drawing area. Fixing this unlocked the robot's full 1m x 1m drawing field . ● Optimization: We meticulously tuned the movement delays and added weighting to the marker head, which stabilized the motion and produced continuous, non-choppy lines .</p>

    <p>Description The initial design concept for an advanced programming course project, detailing a whiteboard-drawing robot based on a vertical rail and wheel-driven system.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This document outlines the initial brainstorming, design, and planning phase for our Quarter 1 advanced computer programming project. The goal was to create a robot that could automatically draw on a classroom whiteboard based on a user's digital input. Working with Edwin Tenney, our first major concept was a "Vertical Rail Robot." The design envisioned a tall, pole-like robot that spanned the height of the board and would drive horizontally along the whiteboard's top and bottom rails using wheels. A marker-holding "head" would then travel up and down this vertical pole. We developed a comprehensive set of documentation for this concept (linked below), which included: ● Detailed User Requirements: Covering both the robot's physical attributes (e.g., using standard Expo markers, an automatic erasing mechanism, magnetic board contact) and the web UI's features (e.g., free-draw, text input, import/export of designs, coordinate grid presets). ● Essential Features: We also incorporated specific requests from our teacher, Mr. Kerkhoff, focusing on speed, low noise operation, precision, and battery life. ● A Full Test Plan: This outlined potential failure cases (like obstacles on the rail, calibration errors, UI spamming) and their corresponding success criteria, ensuring a robust design. This initial concept was ultimately scrapped due to a lack of necessary parts to build the vertical rail system effectively, which led us to pivot to other designs and finally to the successful --- PAGE 173 --- Polargraph. This document serves as a record of our initial engineering process, problem analysis, and system design.</p>

    <p>Description A collaborative web platform for the WHHS Programming Club (an INTERalliance chapter), allowing a teacher to stream a microscope's video feed from a phone to an entire class of students in real-time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project is a massive continuation and scaling-up of my "DigiScope" prototype, now serving as the year-long competition project for the Walnut Hills High School Programming Club (an INTERalliance chapter) for the 2026 TechOlympics. To align with our school mascot (the Eagle) and the TechOlympics theme ("Envision"), the project was renamed EagleVision . Our goal is to create a platform that makes microscope use in a K-12 environment cheaper, safer, and more accessible. It allows a single microscope to be used by an entire class, with each student getting a virtual "front-row seat." The architecture is centered around a phone (using the Android APK from DigiScope V2) mounted to the microscope, which streams its camera feed to a custom website. The website is split into two roles: Teacher (Host) and Student. To gain host privileges, the teacher enters a unique code displayed on the phone's app. From there, they can create a session and allow students to join. Our brainstorming and user requirements phase mapped out a rich feature set: ● Core Stream: Phone captures and sends the live video feed to the website. ● Teacher Controls: ○ Host a session with a unique code/link for students. ○ Manage Student Permissions: Control which features (e.g., annotations, screenshots) students can access, making the platform scalable for different age groups and learning objectives. ○ Control brightness, RGB color filters, and digital pan/zoom. --- PAGE 170 --- ○ Draw/annotate on the live feed, with the ability to show/hide annotations for the class. ○ Take high-quality screenshots and recordings. ○ End the session. ● Student Access: ○ Join a session via the teacher's link. ○ View the live, annotated feed. ○ Make their own private annotations on their screen (if permitted by the teacher). ○ Take their own screenshots (if permitted by the teacher). ● Future Goals: We hope to integrate AI features, such as object identification for common specimens. This project is a major undertaking for our club's competition and design teams, blending mobile development, web development, and real-time video streaming.</p>

  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>-range messaging system using LoRa. A laptop running a Python app messages a portable ESP32 "hotspot" that hosts a modern web UI for multiple devices to connect and reply. Long Description This project was a direct and significant evolution of my previous LoRa thermometer. I created a two-way, off-the-grid messaging system capable of operating with no Wi-Fi or cellular data , leveraging the long-range capabilities of LoRa. The system had two main components: 1. Base Station: This end utilized the Arduino Leonardo and LoRa receiver from my previous project, which was plugged into a laptop. Instead of just using the serial monitor, I developed a Python application that ran on the computer to interpret the serial data from the Arduino, providing a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving messages. 2. Portable Node: This end used the ESP32 and LoRa module . I programmed the ESP32 to operate in Access Point (AP) mode , effectively creating its own local Wi-Fi network. This network hosted a nice, modern-style web UI for messaging. This setup allowed multiple devices (like phones or other laptops) to connect to the ESP32's Wi-Fi, access the web UI, and send messages back to the base station computer, and vice versa. This created a truly independent communication network. Under ideal conditions, this system has a potential range of up to 10km , making it a powerful tool for communication in remote areas.</p>

  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project marked my first venture into the world of LoRa (Long Range) Modules , a low-power wide-area network technology. My goal was to create a digital thermometer that transmitted its data wirelessly over LoRa . On the sending end, I used an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with a LoRa Module and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor . This setup collected environmental data and prepared it for transmission. For the receiving end, I built a display unit using an Arduino Leonardo , another LoRa Module (connected via a level shifter to ensure compatibility), and a small 128x64 pixel OLED screen to display the received temperature data. I also designed and 3D-printed a custom case for the receiver, making it a self-contained and portable unit. I was able to successfully range test the system to the very end of my street, although I had to stop the test there as I lost visual contact with my little brother who was helping me. LoRa modules are advertised to be capable of transmitting data up to 15km in ideal conditions, which opens up many exciting possibilities for future projects as I continue to explore this technology.</p>

    <p>Description Secured, upgraded, and deployed 10 Lenovo E14 business-class laptops from Xavier University for educational initiatives and personal use, leveraging salvaged components.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project involved a significant effort in resource acquisition and deployment of computing resources. Through my summer internship at Xavier University's IT Department, I was able to secure 10 Lenovo E14 business-class laptops from 2021 as a one off agreement . These machines were earmarked for various impactful uses: the majority will support the beginner teaching program of the Walnut Hills High School Programming Club (of which I am president), while others were provided to my siblings who lacked personal computers. A particularly meaningful deployment is for my cousin in Kurdistan, who shares my passion for STEM and Arduino but has limited access to technology and opportunities. I plan to equip him with one of these laptops, along with Arduino kits and tools, to kickstart his STEM journey. During the setup of the E14s for transport, I discovered that each laptop had an empty second NVMe SSD slot . Recognizing this upgrade potential, I received permission from my supervisors at Xavier University to harvest RAM and 256GB SSDs from old, unusable desktops previously used in the university's diner/sandwich shops. Despite being covered in a mix of grease and dust externally, the internal components of these discarded desktops were clean. I successfully salvaged 8 SSDs and 8 RAM sticks . The RAM was harvested to prevent it from being discarded, and the SSDs will be utilized to upgrade the E14 laptops from 256GB to 512GB storage , significantly enhancing their utility for their new users. This project highlights skills in asset management, hardware diagnostics, and leveraging available resources for community and personal benefit.</p>

    <p>Description Acquired, diagnosed, and upgraded a discarded Dell Precision 7520 laptop, transforming it into a powerful modern system by maximizing RAM and uncovering a hidden NVMe SSD.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project began with a surprising discovery during cleanup at our Xavier IT workbench. We came across a bulky Dell laptop, seemingly from 2010, and initially relegated it to the e-waste pile. However, a closer look in the warehouse revealed a USB-C Thunderbolt port and an Intel i7 7th Gen processor —unusual for its apparent age. Further investigation of its serial number confirmed it was a Dell Precision 7520 from 2016 , once touted as the "Most Powerful Laptop in the World." This machine boasted four SODIMM RAM slots , an NVMe M.2 SSD slot , Thunderbolt 3 , and an NVIDIA Quadro M1200 GPU, indicating immense upgrade potential. After receiving permission to upgrade it with available parts and keep it, I immediately imaged it to Windows 11 at work. Upon setting it up at home, I was astonished by its inherent speed and modern feel. A peculiar mystery arose: the system reported two NVMe M.2 SSDs despite only one visible port and no apparent HDD, even though I'd seen a SATA drive shell. Upon returning to work, I proceeded with a RAM upgrade to 32GB . This wasn't entirely smooth; one SODIMM stick was faulty, requiring debugging assistance from Doug Hanson to identify and replace it. The ultimate solution to the SSD mystery was revealed during further disassembly to access the additional RAM slots under the keyboard. The "SATA drive" I'd seen was surprisingly light; flipping it over, I discovered it was actually an NVMe SSD adapter , with the HDD shell merely an empty case concealing a second NVMe SSD! This was a stock feature from Dell, a "hot-swappable" slot designed to accommodate both SATA drives and NVMe SSDs via an adapter during a transitional period in 2016. This Dell Precision 7520, with its robust build and powerful features, has since replaced my 2019 Windows 10 HP Pavilion laptop. The Thunderbolt 3 port, absent on my HP, was a particularly welcome addition. It was hardly a fair fight, comparing a top-of-the-line workstation --- PAGE 155 --- from 2016 to a budget office laptop from 2019, but the Dell's remarkable performance after its restoration truly showcased the value of smart upgrades and thorough diagnostics.</p>

    <p>Description Developed the second prototype of "DigiScope," shifting to use a phone's high-quality camera via an Android APK, with plans for a custom nosepiece mount to improve stability.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project marks the second significant iteration of "DigiScope," an ambitious long-term endeavor aimed at digitizing the microscope experience, with the ultimate vision of creating "ClassScope." The ClassScope concept envisions a system where a single teacher-operated microscope transmits its live video feed to a website, accessible by all students. Each student could then individually pan, zoom, and take screenshots from their own device. This innovative approach promises to make microscope usage in K-12 environments easier, cheaper, and safer , allowing schools with limited resources to maximize their equipment and enabling the introduction of microscopy at earlier ages by reducing direct student interaction with delicate instruments. This rendition of DigiScope, Version 2 , pivoted entirely after realizing the Pi Camera's limitations for a high-quality view in the previous version. I decided to switch approaches, designing an Android APK to leverage my phone's superior camera quality and have the phone serve as both the image capture device and the data transmitter. This was a completely new turn, but my extensive Java experience from APCSA and Robotics (especially using Android Studio) proved incredibly useful in designing and deploying the app. It was so efficient that when I pressed run on my desktop, my phone automatically opened the APK file and ran it—enabling seamless wireless debugging ! Initially, I used an open-source 3D-printed design to mount my phone to the microscope eyepiece. However, this proved problematic: my phone was too large and heavy for the design (which was intended for smaller, lighter phones like an iPhone 6), and the microscope's eyepiece itself was not stable, causing wobbling . The prototype's simple UI is functional, but it has yet to achieve website connectivity. The next crucial step is to redesign the mounting arm so that it attaches directly to the nosepiece of the microscope instead. This will ensure the --- PAGE 149 --- phone is held firmly in place and will be specifically designed for my phone's dimensions, providing the stability needed for further development and the ultimate goal of ClassScope.</p>

    <p>Description Successfully implemented a wireless Limelight proxy on Leviathan, enabling live neural detector testing and diagnosing a critical wire fault, significantly streamlining vision system debugging.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This mini-project was a crucial step in refining Leviathan's vision system, especially as the robot had been handed off to the rookies for preparation for the Michiana Premier Event , the last competition of the season. After a challenging week of debugging, we successfully got a wireless Limelight proxy working on the robot. This wireless proxy was the first step in addressing persistent issues with the Limelight randomly disconnecting. Its implementation immediately clarified the problem: a faulty wire that would disconnect every time the robot moved, something incredibly difficult to diagnose without live feedback. With the proxy in place, we were able to see our neural detector in action live on the field. Previously, to view Limelight's output or make changes, we had to physically unplug it from the robot, connect it to a laptop, wait 30 seconds for it to boot, access the values, make a change, and then hope it worked after rewiring. The wireless proxy completely transformed this workflow, making debugging significantly faster and more efficient. The Limelight proxy was part of a new, in-development dashboard being built by other FTC teams. Integrating it with our existing codebase required extensive Gradle debugging until it finally worked seamlessly. This project not only solved a critical hardware issue but also provided invaluable real-time insights into our vision system's performance.</p>

    <p>Description This project was my first attempt at using an Arduino Leonardo to create a practical tool for our FTC team during the "Into The Deep" season. My goal was to develop a prototype score tracker that could be used at competitions. The core of the project involved displaying game data and scores on a small 128x64 pixel OLED display . The user interface was designed to be interactive and navigable using a rotary encoder and a couple of physical buttons . This allowed users to scroll through menus, view saved data pages, and access basic data management options. While I successfully built and programmed this functional prototype, I never proceeded to create a full, enclosed version with a custom case. This decision was largely influenced by the availability of other app-based solutions that proved simpler to integrate into our workflow. Despite remaining a prototype, this project was invaluable for gaining hands-on experience with microcontroller programming, UI/UX design for embedded systems, and hardware interaction.</p>

    <p>Description Designed and 3D-printed an intricate nameplate for an AP Biology teacher, featuring a unique protein model behind each letter of her name, reflecting her passion for biology.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project was an intricate and highly personalized gift designed for my AP Biology teacher, Dr. Harsh, upon her retirement. My goal was to create a custom nameplate where each letter of her name was accompanied by a 3D-printed protein model whose name began with the same letter, placed on a pedestal behind it. This required extensive research to find suitable protein models that were both scientifically accurate and visually appealing. I used Onshape to CAD the baseplate and pedestals , ensuring a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing foundation. The protein models themselves presented a unique challenge. Initially, I attempted to use molecularly accurate models, but these proved far too complex for my 3D printer, as evidenced by a complete failure when trying to print a histone. This led to many redesigns and a pivot to using community-designed protein models that had been specifically optimized for printability. I utilized Blender to smooth and simplify these models for successful fabrication. For fun, before printing, I even managed to render a model with accurate color in Blender . The final piece was printed using pearl white plastic for the base and pedestals, with black PLA for the letters of her name, making them truly pop. This project was a deeply rewarding experience, combining my love for STEM and biology with my growing expertise in 3D design and printing.</p>

    <p>Description A ground-up redesign of the FTC robot, Cooky V2, featuring an entirely new drivetrain, custom extendo slides, and a pivoting intake, all controlled by a completely reworked, modular Java codebase.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project marked a complete departure and total redesign from the original "Rooky" bot . Cooky V2 was built from the ground up, with no similar design choices to its predecessor. It featured an entirely different drivetrain design and a new type of mecanum wheel. The primary purpose of this rendition was for Edwin and me to gain comprehensive experience in constructing, designing, and coding complex linear slides . We successfully integrated a set of extendo slides as well as a pivoting intake mechanism onto Cooky V2. We did the initial designs with help from our mentor Itzha Lopez who was a mechanical engineer at P&G and a former FIRST Robotics Competition Member in Texas. In stark contrast to the first Rooky bot, which started with an already assembled drivetrain, we meticulously designed Cooky V2 fully in Onshape first , before proceeding with the physical build. The robot's code was also completely reworked to embrace a more scalable and organized structure. Instead of having a single, monolithic Java file that included all of the hardware declarations, controls, and everything in one long 600+ line file, I split the codebase into two distinct folders: OpModes (containing the code that would be run) and Subsystems . This created a truly modular coding environment , allowing me to easily mix and match different Java classes, such as a dedicated Claw class or a Mecanum drivetrain class. This modularity streamlined development and debugging, transforming the coding process from verbose, repetitive commands to cleaner, more abstract calls. For example, instead of: int closedPosition = 50; Servo intakeClaw; --- PAGE 131 --- intakeClaw = hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, "intakeClaw"); intakeClaw.setPostion(closedPosition); We could simply write: Claw.close(); This project was a monumental step in our team's engineering maturity, showcasing advanced mechanical design, robust coding practices, and effective teamwork.</p>

    <p>Description Designed and fabricated a custom fume extractor for soldering by repurposing a salvaged fan, designing a 3D-printable mount, and building a power circuit with a rechargeable battery.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description As my interest in soldering grew, I quickly realized the importance of proper ventilation to safely deal with the resulting fumes. Instead of purchasing a pre-made unit, I opted to design a custom solution. The project centered around a powerful fan that I had salvaged from a tabletop air hockey game. Using CAD software , I designed a specialized mount for the fan. This mount not only housed the fan securely but was also engineered to be held by my existing "helping hands" tool, allowing for versatile positioning and hands-free operation. The design was then brought to life using a 3D printer . The project also involved electronics and soldering . I designed and assembled a custom circuit with a rechargeable battery and a power switch to make the fan a self-contained, portable unit. The final product was incredibly powerful and has dramatically improved my soldering workspace by efficiently redirecting and dispersing the air of harmful fumes. This project was a great exercise in combining mechanical design, fabrication, and basic electronics to create a highly functional and practical tool.</p>

    <p>Description Replaced a proprietary HDD/Intel Optane setup with a single NVMe SSD, successfully migrating the operating system and dramatically improving the laptop's performance and battery efficiency.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description My HP Pavilion laptop, despite having a relatively new battery, was plagued with inconsistent performance and poor battery life. Boot times were often frustratingly slow, occasionally taking up to 40 minutes, which was especially problematic during robotics team meetings. The root of the issue appeared to be the original proprietary hard disk drive (HDD), which was consistently running at over 80% disk usage, causing overheating and power inefficiency. The system used an NVMe M.2 Intel Optane memory module to "accelerate" the HDD. Recognizing an opportunity for a significant upgrade, I decided to disable the Intel Optane module and replace it with a new NVMe M.2 solid-state drive (SSD). While the process seemed straightforward in theory, the practical application was anything but. It required a full week of dedicated troubleshooting , BIOS configuration , and repeated restarts to get the computer to successfully boot from the new SSD. The payoff, however, was monumental. The upgrade completely transformed the laptop. It became so fast and efficient that it outperformed its original factory state, even in low-power "power saver" mode. The disk usage dropped from a constant 80%+ to a stable sub-10% range. Additionally, the laptop's battery life improved dramatically, going from a mere 30 minutes to lasting for days of regular usage, eliminating my dependence on a constant power source.</p>

    <p>Description Successfully tuned and leveled a 3D printer's print bed to achieve strong, consistent, and reliable first-layer adhesion.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description As a newcomer to the world of 3D printing, I spent the first month of owning my printer unaware that the "stringy, weak" first layers I was getting were not a normal part of the process. This was a critical point in my learning journey, as I learned to identify and solve a fundamental issue with the help of a friend, Owen Wasson . Through a process of trial and error , I learned how to properly level the print bed and adjust the nozzle height (often called "Z-offset"). This process involved making minute adjustments and testing them with small prints, repeating the cycle until the results were consistent. The final outcome was a dramatic improvement. The first layers went from being a fragile, inconsistent mess that could be easily ripped apart to a solid, well-adhered layer that I could not break even with all my strength. This project was a crucial lesson in the importance of proper machine calibration and the impact that small, precise adjustments can have on the quality and reliability of a final product.</p>

    <p>Description Successfully retrained a neural network model for the Limelight camera, creating a driver-assist feature that autonomously aligns the drivetrain for specific "Sample" game pieces.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project was a pivotal return to our neural network approach after encountering a roadblock with our previous computer vision methods. While Aditya, Edwin, and I had been struggling to find a way to reliably separate two touching "Samples," our team member Alex Montello took the initiative to revisit our initial neural network training attempt. We had previously abandoned this path when the Google Colab notebook provided by Limelight stopped working and subsequent training attempts failed. A major breakthrough came when we identified the root cause of the failures: the limited GPU credits provided by the free version of Google Colab. To overcome this, Alex made a crucial decision to spend approximately $20 for enough GPU credits to complete the training . This investment paid off, allowing us to successfully train and deploy a functional neural network detector model. The new model was a proof of concept that worked for a specific, yet crucial, scenario. The system was designed as a driver-assist feature : a driver would get the robot close to a target, then hold a button on the controller to enable the Limelight to take control of the drivetrain , making precise maneuvers to align the claw with the detected sample. The driver was still responsible for triggering the intake and rotating the wrist to complete the pickup . This project was a powerful lesson in resourcefulness, perseverance, and the importance of dedicated teamwork in overcoming complex technical challenges.</p>

    <p>Description Developed a third version of the Python SnapScript using minAreaRect to generate precise polygon bounding boxes from color thresholding and edge detection, with guidance from an Oracle mentor.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project represented a significant evolution of our Python SnapScript, moving from a simple aspect ratio analysis to a more sophisticated, geometric approach. With invaluable guidance from Will Reed, a Principal Machine Learning Engineer at Oracle , our team was able to leverage a key computer vision function: minAreaRect() . This new approach allowed us to use color thresholding and edge detection to generate an actual polygon around the detected "Sample" game piece. This method gave us a much more precise bounding box, which was a huge step up from simply analyzing aspect ratios. The polygons provided a more accurate representation of the object's shape and orientation on the field. The knowledge gained from this project, combined with our newly acquired OpenCV certifications , allowed us to write more robust and effective vision scripts. While this version was a major improvement, we recognized that the issue of distinguishing between samples that were positioned very close to one another was still present enough that it needed further attention. This project solidified our foundation in advanced computer vision techniques and demonstrated the power of real-world mentorship.</p>

    <p>Description Advanced the Python SnapScript vision system to utilize aspect ratio for sample orientation, enabling autonomous detection and auto-rotation for all three sample colors (red, yellow, blue) for the competition robot.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description Building on our initial Python SnapScript work, this iteration represented a significant leap forward in our vision system for Leviathan . After extensive work and tinkering, we successfully utilized the aspect ratio of the detected bounding box to gain a general understanding of the "Sample" game piece's orientation – whether it was vertical, horizontal, or anywhere in between. This breakthrough was crucial, as our claw was capable of picking up a sample even if it was up to 45 degrees off in terms of rotation . A memorable part of this development occurred during a late-night programming and debugging session in our hotel lobby at a competition (the camera wasn't in use yet, we just had a burst of inspiration!). During this intense, hot chocolate-fueled night, we managed to integrate the vision system with the robot's hardware. While we didn't have the full physical robot, we used the control hub (the brain of the bot) and an iteration of our claw, which was simply handheld but had wrist rotation. The highlight of this version was successfully developing a SnapScript that could handle all three sample colors (red, yellow, blue) and autonomously auto-rotate the robot to pick up the samples with precision. We recorded a multitude of clips throughout the night, documenting our progress. To cap off the effort, I even edited an excessively cinematic short movie detailing the full timeline of going from an unoperational system to achieving robust, three-color detection. This project truly showcased our dedication to perfecting autonomous vision for competition.

    <p>Description Developed the first iteration of a Python SnapScript vision system for Leviathan, utilizing OpenCV for color and edge detection to identify single "Sample" game pieces.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description Following our initial attempt with neural networks, we pivoted our vision strategy for Leviathan to Python SnapScripts on the Limelight 3A, recognizing the importance of starting with simpler, foundational methods as recommended by Limelight documentation. This project marked the beginning of our long journey to perfect this vision system. For this first version, we focused on using basic OpenCV functionalities. We implemented edge detection and color detection to accurately capture the target "Sample" game pieces. In this iteration, we were still using a bounding box for detection, which was accurately placed on the bottom-left and top-right corners of the sample. However, this bounding box approach meant we did not have rotation data , as it doesn't inherently provide information about the object's orientation. The goal for this iteration was to reliably identify a single, lone Sample on the field. During this time, while Aditya already had some experience, Edwin and I both dedicated ourselves to learning OpenCV more deeply. We enrolled in and completed the OpenCV University Bootcamp , where we both earned Honors Certificates and became certified in OpenCV . This foundational work, despite its initial limitation to single object detection and the challenge of extracting rotation data, was crucial for building our expertise in computer vision for robotics.</p>

    <p>Description The first attempt at training a neural network for Leviathan using a Limelight-provided Google Colab notebook and a tflite model, aimed at improving autonomous "Sample" detection.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description Following the extensive work on creating our custom dataset, this project marked the crucial next step: training the Neural Network for our competition robot, Leviathan . We utilized a Google Colab notebook specifically provided by Limelight , which streamlined the training process. This notebook leveraged a pre-existing model in the tflite format , a unique and optimized format for Limelight's vision processing capabilities. Our process involved feeding our meticulously annotated dataset into this setup to begin training the model. Once trained, we were able to successfully deploy and test the model on the Limelight 3A camera . However, the initial results revealed that the model's accuracy and consistency were pretty bad , making it clear that a significant rework was needed. Crucially, after this attempt, we collectively decided to pivot away from neural networks for the time being. We realized that we had skipped too far ahead in our vision development. According to Limelight's documentation and the success of other teams, the recommended approach is to start small and simple , then gradually work your way up to more complex methods like neural networks. Therefore, our next step became focusing on trying to implement a custom Python SnapScript for object detection. This project, while not achieving its initial goal, was invaluable in highlighting the iterative nature of machine learning development and the importance of following best practices in robotics vision. The Rooky Bot continued to serve as our crucial test vessel for all these Limelight experiments.</p>

    <p>Description An ambitious attempt to control an RC car drivetrain via Bluetooth using an ESP32 and a Dualshock 4 controller, integrated with a Raspberry Pi 4 for live FPV camera feedback.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project was my first foray into using an ESP32 board , with the goal of achieving Bluetooth control over an RC car's drivetrain using a Dualshock 4 controller . The vision was to pair this with a Raspberry Pi 4-based camera/FPV system to provide live video feedback during driving. The project presented significant challenges, primarily due to the RC car's cheap, off-brand nature. Its steering mechanism wasn't a standard servo but a 5-wire motor hooked up to a potentiometer , making it extremely unstable and difficult to program. Despite extensive programming tweaks, debugging, and the implementation of PID control and smoothening algorithms , the car remained very jittery. A major roadblock was discovered when my H-bridge motor driver proved unable to handle the current required by the motor, causing the project to ultimately fail due to insufficient power delivery. I even attempted a second time using a VEX Robotics drivetrain, but those motors also drew too much current for the H-bridge. Given the demanding schoolwork and new robotics tasks that arose, I decided to conclude the project. While not fully successful in its operational goals, I gained valuable insight and skills in complex electronics, wireless control, and advanced debugging, making it a worthwhile learning experience.</p>

    <p>Description Designed and 3D-printed a custom adapter to mount a large, upcycled fan from an air hockey game onto a Raspberry Pi 4 case for powerful cooling, involving creative 3D pen repairs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project involved creating an unconventional yet highly effective cooling solution for my Raspberry Pi 4 . I began by harvesting a large, oversized fan from an old desktop air hockey game. Having already 3D-printed a case for my Raspberry Pi 4 (which I was just learning to use), the challenge was to integrate this powerful fan. Using Onshape , along with precise measurements and reference photos , I designed a custom adapter that would allow the large fan to slot directly into an opening on the RPi case. While the design perfectly attached to the fan, the adapter unfortunately warped during printing , preventing it from fitting correctly into the RPi case's slot. This led to some 3D pen magic : I used my 3D pen to directly attach the mouth of the fan adapter to the opening on the top of the RPi case. It was an extremely inefficient method, but the result was a very powerful cooling system. The fan required an external battery/power source to operate, which luckily I had salvaged from the air hockey game, complete with its original power switch. This project is a testament to creative problem-solving and functionality over aesthetics!</p>

    <p>Description Designed and 3D-printed a custom, cage-like clamping mechanism with an adjustable ball joint for a USB webcam to mount on a large desk monitor , including an unexpected and creative repair process.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project involved creating a new mount for our USB webcam after its original mechanism broke beyond repair. This was a completely separate task from the dashcam project and was specifically for my dad's desk. I started with an existing online design for an M6 screw-on camera, but our webcam no longer had the M6 threading since it had broken off with the original clamp. This required me to redesign the M6 mount into a custom, cage-like contraption that securely clasped the webcam. The design also included an adjustable angle using a ball joint for flexible positioning, crucial for a larger-than-usual monitor clamp . However, during the redesign, I accidentally made it incompatible with the original ball joint, forcing me to use glue. In a classic "measure twice, cut once" moment, I then realized I had glued the camera holder base upside down! To fix this, I had to cut off the entire camera holder base and ball joint using heated X-Acto knives, and then reattach it the right way up using my 3D pen. It was surprisingly fun to mend a 3D print with a 3D pen, even if it left some hidden soot marks and gold filament. Luckily, my dad only needed it to work, not look perfect, and it's still in use on his desk monitor to this day , proving its functionality despite the mishaps! This project was a great lesson in iterative design, real-world problem-solving, and creative repair techniques.</p>

    <p>Description This project was a significant milestone as it represented my first real-world application of 3D design and printing to solve a practical problem. The task was to replace the broken ball joint and clipping mechanism for our car's dash camera mount. This was the first time I designed and printed something entirely from scratch , and it marked my introduction to Onshape , a professional CAD software. The process involved meticulously taking measurements using calipers to ensure precision. I then used Onshape to redesign both the clipping mechanism for secure attachment and an accurately sized ball joint for flexible positioning. After designing, I 3D-printed the part. The successful outcome is evident as the custom mount worked perfectly and is still in use in our car today , demonstrating the durability and functionality of the redesigned component. This project greatly enhanced my skills in precision measurement, CAD software, and practical engineering.</p>

    <p>Description Integrated a Limelight 3A camera for autonomous detection and slow approach of yellow "Sample" game pieces using color thresholding.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This phase marked the beginning of our Limelight 3A journey , and it was a pivotal moment as we shifted our focus from the "Rooky" robot to developing for our actual competition robot, Leviathan . The "Rooky" bot became a crucial test vessel for this advanced vision system. The Limelight 3A is a specialized, easy-to-use vision processing camera commonly used in competitive robotics, particularly in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It's designed to quickly and accurately identify and track targets, such as April Tags, game pieces, or other objects, using built-in image processing features. This allows robots to "see" and react to their environment autonomously. Beyond basic color thresholding, the Limelight 3A also supports more advanced applications like Python SnapScripts and neural networks for more sophisticated object recognition and analysis. Our primary goal was to enable the robot to autonomously detect and pick up target blocks , specifically the yellow "Sample" game pieces from the 2024-2025 FTC season, "Into The Deep." We developed programming that utilized color thresholding with the Limelight as our starting point for object detection. While we achieved a somewhat reliable system where the robot would very slowly approach a detected yellow Sample, we had plans to continue exploring and implementing other methods to find the most robust and accurate detection solution. This entire effort was aimed at making the camera system good enough to be used on our actual competition robot, Leviathan , with the Rooky Bot serving as a crucial test vessel for development and refinement. This project was a crucial step in advancing the robot's ability to interact autonomously with game elements, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated object manipulation and scoring routines. Throughout this, our existing drivetrain served as the foundational mobile platform, or "carrier," for this advanced vision system.</p>

The design process was conducted using Tinkercad for initial modeling and OrcaSlicer for preparing the print, as I had not yet learned Onshape. This project was particularly significant as it was one of my very first endeavors with my new 3D printer, which I had acquired only a week prior. Despite being new to both 3D design and printing, I successfully brought the concept to life, showcasing early skills in digital fabrication and creative problem-solving.</p>

  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project focused on a critical redesign of the "Rooky" robot's claw mechanism , addressing significant issues encountered with the initial version. The first claw often broke and scraped against the ground, hindering the robot's performance. The new iteration, 3D-printed in durable Navy PLA , was engineered to resolve these problems. Key improvements in this Claw Redesign (v2) include: ● Enhanced Ground Clearance: The new design ensured the claw no longer came into contact with the ground, preventing damage and improving maneuverability. ● Stable U-Channel Mount: A special U-channel was integrated into the design, providing a firm and consistent mounting point that held the claw at the optimal height. ● Improved Block Acquisition: When the claw was open, its redesigned geometry allowed it to pass over blocks without collision, making it significantly easier and more reliable to pick up targets. This iteration was also optimized for two-driver operation , with one driver controlling the robot's movement and the other dedicated to operating the claw's open/close functions. This project was a practical lesson in iterative design , mechanical problem-solving , and improving robot functionality based on field testing and feedback.</p>

    <p>Description This phase marked a significant advancement in the "Rooky" robot's autonomous capabilities by introducing a physical distance sensor . This sensor was integrated with the existing April Tag cycling program to enable collision avoidance , making the robot more robust in dynamic environments. The videos demonstrate the robot's improved resilience; it was able to continue its cycling routine even while being "bullied" or interfered with, proving to be quite stubborn and capable of staying on track. A key improvement was its ability to recover autonomously : if the robot temporarily lost sight of the next April Tag in its sequence, it would simply spin in place (a maneuver facilitated by the mecanum drivetrain) until it re-acquired the correct tag ID, then resume its approach. This project deepened our understanding of sensor fusion, reactive autonomous behaviors, and creating highly reliable navigation systems for competitive robotics.</p>

The development involved multiple iterations, starting with a simpler program to approach any visible April Tag (which, as documented by a cool compilation video, initially had some amusing failures!). By the end of this weekend-long effort, we achieved a functional autonomous cycler . The final program allowed the robot to: 1. Detect April Tag 12 and approach it , stopping approximately 20cm in front and aligning itself straight. 2. Turn right until it detected the next April Tag in the sequence. 3. Approach the newly detected tag , utilizing the advantages of the mecanum drivetrain to correct its heading on the way. 4. Repeat the turning and approaching process. This sequence created an infinite loop , cycling through April Tags 12, 13, 14, and 15, then restarting at 12.

    <p>Description Building upon the foundational drivetrain, this phase of the 'Rooky' robot project focused on enhancing its scoring capabilities and driver control. We designed and fabricated a small claw mechanism from gold silk PLA (a type of 3D printer filament). However, this initial claw often broke easily and scraped on the floor, which was a real pain. It also made it tough to maneuver the robot to pick up blocks because the claw would collide with them. Concurrently, we developed and programmed a 'Turtle mode' for the robot's drivetrain. This feature allows the driver to toggle between fast and slow driving speeds, providing greater precision for intricate maneuvers. To enhance the driver's experience, the system was programmed to provide vibration feedback on the controller, clearly indicating the active speed setting. This project demonstrated our ability to integrate new hardware (the claw) with existing systems and implement advanced control features for improved robot performance.</p>

    <p>Description A custom Arduino Leonardo-based button deck featuring a rotary encoder for cycling through four distinct keyboard command profiles, indicated by LEDs, and four programmable snap buttons for versatile input.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project involved the design and construction of a highly versatile Arduino Leonardo-based button deck , intended to serve as a custom input device for various applications, similar to a streaming or gaming macro pad. The core functionality revolves around its ability to emulate keyboard strokes directly, thanks to the Arduino Leonardo's native USB HID capabilities. The device features a rotary encoder that allows the user to cycle through four distinct profiles of keyboard keybinds. Each profile is visually indicated by one of four dedicated LEDs , providing clear feedback on the active mode. In addition to the rotary encoder's push-button, there are four tactile snap buttons that act as programmable "keys." The specific keyboard command sent by each of these buttons changes depending on the currently selected profile. For instance, one profile might map the buttons to WASD movement and Spacebar, while another could map them to arrow keys or numerical inputs (1, 2, 3, 4, Enter), or even special functions like Backspace and Delete. This project was an excellent exercise in microcontroller programming (C++), custom hardware design , electronics assembly , and creating a highly customizable human-computer interface.</p>

    <p>Description Upgraded a personal HP laptop by replacing the battery and upgrading the RAM, and resolved performance issues by reimaging the operating system back to Windows 10 after a problematic Windows 11 upgrade.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project involved a significant overhaul of my personal HP laptop to address severe performance degradation that occurred after upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11. This slowdown was identified as a widespread glitch associated with the in-place upgrade process. To improve hardware performance, I replaced the laptop's battery and upgraded the RAM , which are common hardware enhancements for speed and longevity. However, the core issue persisted due to the Windows 11 upgrade glitch. Since the deadline to officially downgrade back to Windows 10 had passed, the solution required a full reimage of the operating system back to Windows 10. This process involved backing up data, performing a clean installation, and reinstalling necessary drivers and software. After these combined hardware and software interventions, the laptop's speed and performance were fully restored. This project honed my skills in hardware maintenance, operating system troubleshooting, and data management.] (I updated this description Aug 2025, after figuring out at my Xavier IT Internship that the problem was widespread and even the university had issues and chase to reimage to 11 instead of inplace upgrade.)</p>

    <p>Description A custom dashboard attachment for a steering wheel, built with an Arduino Leonardo, that emulates keyboard strokes and features a parking brake status LED.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project involved creating a practical dashboard attachment for a steering wheel, designed to replace the need for a physical keyboard during certain activities by emulating keyboard strokes. The core of the system was an Arduino Leonardo , chosen for its native USB HID (Human Interface Device) capabilities, allowing it to act directly as a keyboard. The dashboard included various buttons or inputs mapped to specific keyboard commands, making common actions more accessible from the steering wheel. A key feature was a red LED indicator for the parking brake status, providing immediate visual feedback. A memorable (and slightly terrifying) debugging experience occurred during the initial testing phase. My first attempt at a simple one-wire keyboard setup kept failing. After many tries, when it finally did work, it launched into an unstoppable loop, relentlessly typing "I AM ALIVE" at lightning speed every time it was plugged into a computer (after a 2-second delay!). This made uploading code fixes incredibly difficult as the board would type over the IDE. After several frustrated attempts, I managed to use the board's physical reboot button to buy just enough time to initiate the upload and open a new notepad file to capture the "I AM ALIVE" manifesto. That file, AMALIVE.txt , still exists as a testament to the debugging struggle!</p>

  <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
    <p>Description This project was less about coding and more about embracing the great outdoors... and a bit of accidental destruction. My dad and I teamed up to tackle two stubborn trees in the backyard. We were all about that teamwork and those trusty ratchet straps to guide the trees down. Things were going great until, oops , one of the trees decided to take out a section of our metal fence on its way down. So, what started as a tree-cutting mission quickly turned into an impromptu fence reconstruction project! It was a real crash course in problem-solving, using tools (and maybe a bit of duct tape, metaphorically speaking), and learning that sometimes, projects come with unexpected, hilarious detours. Definitely a memorable bonding experience!</p>

    <p>Description This portfolio entry details my work in a foundational Python programming course with Dr. Hawzhin, focusing on several key collaborative notebooks. The Grade Compiler project taught me how to use loops and lists to handle and organize user-provided data, simulating a basic teacher's tool. The Guess My Number game was an exercise in building interactive applications, utilizing conditional statements and random number generation to create a fun, two-player game with clear game logic. The Clock Angler challenged my mathematical and logical reasoning by calculating the angle between a clock's hands at a user-defined or random time. The Cash Register project simulated a virtual market, using loops and conditional statements to create a running total and receipt. Finally, The MultiCalculator was a demonstration of code reusability and organization, combining several individual calculator functions into a single, user-friendly application. This entire course provided a solid base for future programming endeavors.</p>
