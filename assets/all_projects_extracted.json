However, this proved problematic: my phone was too large and heavy for the design (which was intended for smaller, lighter phones like an iPhone 6), and the microscope's eyepiece itself was not stable, causing wobbling. The prototype's simple UI is functional, but it has yet to achieve website connectivity. The next crucial step is to redesign the mounting arm"
