                    <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
                        <p>The initial phase of our advanced programming project focused on design exploration and rapid prototyping. We evaluated several approaches including: 1) A magnetic robot design that was quickly abandoned due to complexity, 2) A vertical rail robot concept that couldn't proceed due to parts limitations, and 3) A sprocket/bead chain design that we attempted to CAD but ultimately had to abandon. These iterations led to our successful polargraph implementation.</p>

This hotspot creates its own Wi-Fi network and hosts a modern web interface, allowing multiple devices to connect, view, and respond to messages without requiring internet connectivity. The project demonstrates the potential for creating accessible communication solutions for remote areas or emergency scenarios.</p>

                    <h3>3D Printing Mastery</h3>
                    <p>From weak first layers to reliable prints: A journey of mastering 3D printer calibration, bed leveling, and understanding the critical relationship between nozzle height and adhesion.</p>
                    <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
                        <p>In my first month with a 3D printer, I struggled with consistently poor first layer adhesion, not realizing this wasn't normal. Through systematic experimentation and research, I learned the crucial relationship between nozzle height, bed leveling, and print adhesion. I developed a calibration process that involves precise bed leveling using feeler gauges, temperature tuning, and first-layer speed optimization. This experience laid the foundation for successful future 3D printing projects and taught me valuable lessons about mechanical precision and troubleshooting.</p>

                    <div class="project-extended-desc" style="display:none;">
                        <p>Building on our initial Python SnapScript work, we achieved a major breakthrough in our Leviathan robot's vision system. By analyzing the aspect ratio of detected bounding boxes, we could determine the orientation of game pieces - whether vertical, horizontal, or at angles. This was crucial for autonomous operation, as it allowed the robot to adjust its approach and grip based on the piece's position. The system successfully handled red, yellow, and blue samples, providing reliable detection and orientation data in competition conditions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>
                        <p>This portfolio entry details my work in a foundational Python programming course with Dr. Hawzhin, focusing on several key collaborative notebooks. The Grade Compiler project taught me how to use loops and lists to handle and organize user-provided data, simulating a basic teacher's tool. The Guess My Number game was an exercise in building interactive applications, utilizing conditional statements and random number generation to create a fun, two-player game with clear game logic. The Clock Angler challenged my mathematical and logical reasoning by calculating the angle between a clock's hands at a user-defined or random time. The Cash Register project simulated a virtual market, using loops and conditional statements to create a running total and receipt. Finally, The MultiCalculator was a demonstration of code reusability and organization, combining several individual calculator functions into a single, user-friendly application. This entire course provided a solid base for future programming endeavors.</p>
